# Deepfake Assessment Support System ðŸŽ“ðŸ¤–

This project uses advanced deepfake technology to help students pass online English exams, university admission interviews, and other assessments with confidence.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- A skilled professional takes the test or interview **on behalf of the student**.
- The **studentâ€™s face is mapped** onto the professional in real-time using deepfake technology.
- The interviewer sees the student on screen, **without realizing** someone else is giving the test.
- The system ensures smooth audio-video syncing and real-time interaction.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- DeepFaceLab / FaceSwap / Avatarify (choose what you used)
- Python (for core logic and automation)
- OpenCV / MediaPipe (for real-time face tracking)
- OBS / Virtual Camera (for streaming output)
- Audio routing tools (like Voicemeeter, if applicable)

## âœ… Features

- Real-time face mapping
- Smooth video and voice synchronization
- Secure & private session handling
- Works with most video conferencing tools (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
